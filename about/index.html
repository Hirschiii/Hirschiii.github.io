<h2>About me</h2>

I'm Niklas von Hirschfeld and I live in germani. I'm still in school
and just experimenting with <i>GNU/linux</i>. This site is build
with Jekyll and all my notes I take in school are automaticly transformed 
to static html with kramdown.

In addition to that I write my own wiki for some stuff. Currently 
I researching for neovim and its package management and the expended <i>http</i>
protocoll <i>WebDAV</i>.
